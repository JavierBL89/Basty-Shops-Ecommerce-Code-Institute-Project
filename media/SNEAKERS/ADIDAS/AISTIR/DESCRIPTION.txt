RUNNING-INSPIRED SHOES MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED CONTENT.
To be bold is to be you. Express yourself fully with these adidas Astir Shoes. The high-impact look throws it back to the 2000s, a time when there was no such thing as "too much." Distinctive details and exaggerated proportions take full inspiration from that era of excess and indulgence.
