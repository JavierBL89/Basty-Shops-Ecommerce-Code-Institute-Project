THE ICONIC SAMBA MOVES FORWARD WITH AN ENTIRELY VEGAN DESIGN.
First introduced as an indoor football shoe, the adidas Samba has gone on to cover expansive ground. After their time on the field, these shoes made their mark on stages and streets across the globe. Today they look toward a more conscious future. Done up in faux leather, the revamped icon has eliminated any usage of animal based materials. The look is exactly the same as the original, right down to the famous T-toe.

Made with vegan alternatives to animal-derived ingredients or materials.
