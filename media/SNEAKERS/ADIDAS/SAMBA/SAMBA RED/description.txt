A FESTIVE PAIR OF ADIDAS SAMBA SHOES MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED AND VEGAN MATERIALS.
Classics become classic for a reason. Since 1950, every generation has made the unmistakably sporty lines of the adidas Samba their own. The crisp, clean upper shows off the 3-Stripes just right, and a grippy gum rubber outsole takes you wherever you want to go. This pair takes the shoes in a celebratory direction with a wintry pattern. Hot cocoa not included.

To reduce our reliance on virgin materials, we make sure that our vegan alternatives also contain a minimum of 25% recycled content.
