      - When adding products into shopping bag, the toast showing a success message does not show, however it does when removing items from the shopping bag.
      The code to me looks fine, it prints the print statements i set, also i do not get any error and the the code when running goes through the next function and everything works fine...

      ![Code snippet](<media/Captura de pantalla (426).png>)

  * Unfixed bug
    
      - In large screens css starts to overflow.

      ![Code snippet](<media/Captura de pantalla (606).png>)


 ### Fixed bugs

  * Fixed bug
    
      - Error "TypeError:'dic_values' object is not supscritable
      This occurs when trying to access dic_values object at a specific index(slicing).
      
      I go this error when trying to acces to images list of every product.
      
      * Fix: Convert the dict into a list  `list(my_dict.values())[2:]`


  * Fixed bug:

      - When deploying into heroku could not build a wheel for backports.zoneinfo
      It seems that Heroku by default uses Python vrsion 3.10.x and backports.zoneinfo no works properly with that version of Python 

      * Fix: Create a runtime.txt in the root directory and write your Python version,
       in my case python-3.8.11. Commit and push changes.

  * Fixed bug
    
      - On the bag page, for every item added the layout changes by adding rows in a scalate way.
      Every new row to was pushed to the left.

      ![Items bag page](<media/Captura de pantalla (422).png>)

  * #### Stripe

  - All the code to implement **Stripe** is taken from the walk through Boutiue Ado with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/), i never copied and paste away, i wrote everyting by following my notes or the video lessons when needed.

  ### Media

  - Products pictures were taken from different stores, which is why they are differrent sizes and changes the layout in certain card products.

  - Home page images were taken from [Google images](<https://images.google.com/>)

# Aknowlegments

I want to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) tutor assistance team, which helped me out with some of the day to day code issues. I could have never complete this project without them!

I did not make use of my mentor assistance this time round.
