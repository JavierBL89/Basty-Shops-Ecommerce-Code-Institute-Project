      ![Items bag page](<media/Captura de pantalla (422).png>)

  * Unfixed bug

      ![Products quantity input](<media/Captura de pantalla (424).png>)

   <!-- * Unfixed bug
    
      - Adding a block extra_css tag to every page for the differents apps in order to link them to their own css folder in the app seems to not work for me. After adding this tag and link them to their css file, the styling kept being applied from the stylesheet link added into the base template -->

 * Unfixed bug
    
      - When adding products into shopping bag, the toast showing a success message does not show, however it does when removin items from the shopping bag.
      The code to me looks fine, it prints the print statements i set, also i do not get any error and the the code when running goes through the next function and everything works fine...

      ![Code snippet](<media/Captura de pantalla (426).png>)

 ### Fixed bugs

  * Fixed bug
    
      - Error "TypeError:'dic_values' object is not supscritable
      This occurs when trying to access dic_values object at a specific index(slicing)
      
      I go this error when trying to acces to images list of every product
      
      * Fix: Convert the dict into a list  `list(my_dict.values())[2:]`

  * Fixed bug:

      - The increment and decrement buttons on the bag page gave me a really hard time.
      The buttons would never triggered the js code. I used as in the walk through project the file
      'quantity_form_scripts.html' placed into 'products/includes' folder.

      * Fix: I fix this by getting rid of the above file and placeing the js script in the 'quantity_form.html' file down the file inside the postblockjs tag, then then buttons worked!!

  * Fixed bug:

      - When deploying into heroku could not build a wheel for backports.zoneinfo
      It seems that Heroku by default uses Python vrsion 3.10.x and backports.zoneinfo no works properly with that version of Python 

      * Fix: Create a runtime.txt in the root directory and write your Python version,
       in my case python-3.8.11. Commit and push changes.


## Deployment

The project was deployed to Heroku using the below procedure:-

- Log in to Heroku or create an account if required.

# Aknowlegments

I want to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) tutor assistance team, which helped me out with some of the day to day code issues. I could have never complete this project without them!

I did not make use of my mentor assistance this time round.
